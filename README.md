# HAVAC_Control

The present work carries out the implementation of two classic control techniques: Linear and PI, which include the external temperature as a variable of the control loop. The control system designed here is applied to a mini-split type AC system, to verify the energy consumption when applying these control techniques.

In this repository you will find the code for the Arduino Mega 2560 board, which achieves the aforementioned goal.

The steps carried out to calculate and implement the work were:

1. Temperature and humidity monitoring.
2. Analysis of temperature data.
3. Construction of control algorithm.
4. Implementation.
5. Analysis of results.
